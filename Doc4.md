# DSA Assignment 2 – Question 4
# Doubly Linked List Implementation

A C program that implements a doubly linked list data structure with insert and delete operations.

## 📌 About the Program
This program demonstrates a doubly linked list where each node has pointers to both the next and previous nodes, allowing bidirectional traversal. The implementation uses a structure-based approach with menu-driven operations.

## Features
Insert node at the end of the list
Insert node after a specific node
Delete a node by value
Display the entire list
Bidirectional linking (prev and next pointers)

## Key Functions
Function         Description
**createNode()**    Creates a new node with given data
**insertAfter()**   Inserts node after specified value
**deleteNode()**    Deletes node with given value
**insertAtEnd()**   Adds node at the end
**display()**       Prints the entire list

## Advantages of Doubly Linked List

Bidirectional traversal
Easier deletion (no need to track previous node)
Can traverse backwards from any node

## Disadvantages

Extra memory for prev pointer
More pointer operations during insertion/deletion
