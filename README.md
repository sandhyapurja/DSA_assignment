# DSA Assignment 2 – Question 3
# Reverse Linked List
A C program that implements the reverse traversal algorithm for a singly linked list.
## Description
This program creates a linked list from user input and reverses it using an iterative approach with three pointers. The reversal is done in-place without using extra space.
Features

Create a singly linked list
Insert elements at the end
Reverse the entire list
Display the list before and after reversal
Memory management with proper cleanup

### Algorithm
The reversal uses three pointers:

**prev** - points to the previous node (initially NULL)

**current** - points to the current node being processed

**next** - temporarily stores the next node
